#### React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and IOS apps using React.

#### Using JS to access platform-specific APIs.

#### React components to define the appearance and behavior of the UI.


###  react-dom for **web** apps & react-native for native **mobile** apps.


#### Why React Native?

#### IOS app requires Swift (or) Objective-C.

#### Android app requires Java (or) Kotlin. 

#### But with React Native we can create an app that works on both platforms.
