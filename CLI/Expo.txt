Expo is an open-source framework developed by Expo itself.


ADVANTAGES:

1.  Expo provides an easier experience.

2.  Expo has a suite of tools & services around react-native that simplifies development process.

3.  Gives us many presets out of the box. A lot of commonly used UI components are already made.

4.  With Expo, we can build native apps on windows/linux & still run on our phone.

5.  Setting up a project is easy and can be done in a few minutes.

6.  Sharing the app is very easy (via QR-code or link).

7.  No build necessary to run the app.


DISADVANTAGES:

1.  Less freedom to build the app as we want.

2.  Can't add native modules.

3.  Can't use libraries that use native code in Objective-C/Java.

4.  Large APK Size.

5.  A lot of Firebase - products by Google are not supported by Expo.

6.  Video streaming player available with few configurable controls.

7.  Image caching libraries in expo are not efficient enough to support apps like Instagram.

8.  Require PAID subscription to get faster build, else takes 45 - 60 min.

9.  Realm (database) not supported by Expo.
