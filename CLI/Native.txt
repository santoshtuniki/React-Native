React Native is an open-source framework developed by Meta (Facebook).


ADVANTAGES:

1.  Native CLI provides a freedom to build the app as we want.

2.  Able to implement third-party libraries we need.

3.  Also use the libraries that use native code in Objective-C/Java.

4.  Create as many builds as we need for free at any time.

5.  We can add native modules.


DISADVANTAGES:

1.  Needs Android Studio and XCode to run the projects.

2.  Can't develop for iOS without having a mac.

3.  If we want to share the app, we need to send the whole .apk / .ipa file

4.  Setting up a working project properly take more time.
